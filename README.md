# A framework for simulating spatio-temporal population genomic data on a real geographic landscape

## *Companion repository for our [SMBE 2021 poster](SMBE2021_poster.pdf)*

## Running the code from our poster

You can open an RStudio session with the example script from our poster directly in your web browser (no installation needed):

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/bodkan/smbe2021/main?urlpath=rstudio)

In case the binder cloud instance appears to be starting very slowly, please be patient. The binder cloud server can sometimes take a minute to load up. Sometimes it even crashes completely. If that happens, try reloading the page - this will restart the binder session.

We provide two examples:

- [`poster_example.R`](poster_example.R): a short example from the poster
- [`longer_example.R`](longer_example.R): a longer, more interesting example adapted from the [tutorial](https://bodkan.net/slendr/articles/tutorial.html) vignette

Once the browser-based RStudio session loads, you can open those scripts from the RStudio file browser.

## Project website

You can find extensive documentation at the [project's website](https://bodkan.net/slendr), such as the [manual pages](https://bodkan.net/slendr/reference/index.html) and a detailed [tutorial](https://bodkan.net/slendr/articles/tutorial.html). Everything is still work in progress and we are actively fixing bugs and adding new features. If you are interested in using our software once things become more stable, checking out the project website for updates regularly is a good idea.

## GitHub repository

The GitHub repository of the project is located [here](https://github.com/bodkan/slendr). In case you run into any bugs or if you would like to suggest a new feature, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/issues).
