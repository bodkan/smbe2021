# A framework for simulating spatio-temporal population genomic data on a real geographic landscape

## *Companion repository for the SMBE 2021 poster*

First of all, you can open an RStudio session with the example script from our poster in your browser (no installation needed):

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/bodkan/smbe2021/main?urlpath=rstudio)

Please note that because the binder could instance does not have a SLiM installation, you will not be able to run the **step 6** from our poster (the SLiM simulation itself). Everything else, including the interactive shiny app (**step 5**), should work without any issues. In case the binder appears to be starting very slowly, please be patient. Sometime it takes a while to load up.

## Project website

Our project lives at [www.bodkan.net/spannr](www.bodkan.net/spannr), which is where you can find extensive documentation such as the [manual](https://bodkan.net/spannr/reference/index.html) and a detailed [tutorial](https://bodkan.net/spannr/articles/tutorial.html). Everything is still work in progress and we are working on the project actively. If you are interested in using our software, checking out the project website once in a while is a good idea.

## GitHub repository

The GitHub repository of the project is located [here](https://github.com/bodkan/spannr). In case you run into any bugs or if you would like to suggest a new feature, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/bodkan/spannr/issues).
