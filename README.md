Run an interactive RStudio session with the demo script from our poster in [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/bodkan/smbe2021/master?urlpath=rstudio)!

Note that because SLiM is not installed in the Binder session, the complete simulation itself (final step 6 in the poster example script) will not run. However, you should be able to play around with everything else prior to that step.
